The focus is on understanding the impact of age and player position on goal scoring, with the goal of providing insights for player development, team management, and decision-making processes within football analytics.

The report emphasizes the need for future research to incorporate additional predictor variables, increase sample size, and consider individual differences among players to enhance the accuracy and applicability of the models.

Meticulous data filtering and preprocessing were conducted to ensure the dataset's accuracy and relevance for subsequent analysis, with a specific focus on the English Premier League and goal-scoring events.

Convergence diagnostics were used to ensure the reliability of the model estimates, and the report concludes with reflections on the learnings from the project.
